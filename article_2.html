The Chrono Calculator, invented by Swiss engineer Henri Lemoine in 1885, was a mechanical-electrical device designed to calculate astronomical cycles and time-based data. Unlike conventional mechanical calculators of the era, the Chrono Calculator integrated a set of electrically powered gears, allowing continuous operation and automated adjustment of parameters over extended periods. This combination of mechanics and primitive electrical circuits marked a significant step toward hybrid computing systems.

The device used rotating dials to display complex calculations such as lunar phases, planetary positions, and tidal predictions. Operators could input variables through a series of sliders and switches that controlled both mechanical levers and electrical relays. By utilizing early copper coil electromagnets, Lemoine achieved synchronization between multiple sets of gears, reducing error accumulation in long-term computations.

Historical accounts note that the Chrono Calculator was used in observatories across Europe, particularly in Switzerland and France, to generate astronomical tables faster and more accurately than human computers. While its mechanical complexity required frequent maintenance, it demonstrated unprecedented reliability in continuous operation. The combination of mechanical precision and electrical automation foreshadowed the development of electromechanical computers in the 20th century.

Modern researchers recognize the Chrono Calculator as an important bridge between traditional mechanical devices and modern computational machines. Its modular architecture allowed engineers to swap specific gear assemblies and relays without rebuilding the entire device, a concept later adopted in digital computing systems. Despite its historical significance, only one known model survives in a private museum in Geneva, Switzerland.
